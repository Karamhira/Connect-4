          <p>To play the game, simply click on the column you want to drop your piece in. The piece will appear in the bottom-most empty slot in that column. The game continues until one player wins by getting four pieces in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or until all of the columns are filled and the game is a draw.</p>

        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <p>In this game, players alternate turns dropping their colored pieces, called "checkers," into a grid. The objective is to be the first player to get four of their checkers in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If a player achieves this, they win the game. If the grid becomes completely filled with checkers and no player has won, the game is a draw.</p>
