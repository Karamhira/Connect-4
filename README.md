# Connect-4
Classic board game Connect 4, in which players take turns dropping colored pieces into a grid. The game continues until one player manages to get four of their pieces in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or until the board is completely filled with pieces and no more moves can be made.

# How to Play
To play simply click on the column where you want to place your checker. The piece will then appear in the lowest available empty row in that column. If a column is full, you will not be able to place a piece there. Players will take turns dropping pieces, and the current player's turn is displayed under the game board to prevent any confusion.
